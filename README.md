<em>Some examples of the visualizations that can be found in the dashboard</em>

## Must-knows

### 1. STEPS

#### Users with their own trackman data
- Process raw trackman baseball data with "Add_necessary_columns.R".
- For plotting estimated strike zones of different umpires, your would have to add an additional column "Umpire" to your pitch-level data.
- You're ready to go!

#### Users without data or just want a quick experience
- Download the folder and you're good to go!
- The game data provided by the author are collected is from Opening Day 2023 of CPBL (Taiwanese pro league).
- The umpire data consist of every called strikes and balls from 2018 to 2023 in CPBL. However, these data are not open to public therefore the names of the umpires have been replaced by fake names.

### 2. Pitch Type Abbreviation

| Pitch Type      | Abbreviation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Four-Seamer      | FF       |
| Sinker, Two-Seamer   | ST        |
| Cutter   | CT        |

| Curveball   | CR        |
| Changeup   | CH        |

### 3. Tips

- Everytime the filters in the sidebar have been modified, be sure to hit the "Apply filter" to see the corresponding changes on the graphs. As for filters in the dashboard boxes, the changes will be applied automatically.
- For every multiple-choice-possible filters, after all choices are unselected, they will all be automatically selected again.
- Use "left", "right" and "backspace" keys when using multiple select boxes.

### 4. Notes

- Expected weighted on-base average (xwOBA) value for each batted ball is given by the "xwoba.RData" model trained by the author. Find more about the model here {LINK!!!!!!!}.
- In the "Spray Charts" tab, one will find the filter "Part of the plate" with only two options, "Inside" and "Outside". This is subjective to the batter regardless of the batter handedness.
